        <p>Formed in the Summer of 2018 in Denver, CO, Chompers takes music seriously; they just don’t take themselves too seriously. They’re Genre-Fluid, gliding over Prog, Funk, Electronic, and Hip-Hop roots, and landing on an ethereal sound best described as a Jam-Fusion. With members from New York, Philadelphia, and North Carolina, they’ve taken bits and pieces from a deep bank of influences and are quickly rising up the ranks in Colorado due to their unique blend of styles.</p>
        <p>Two constants of our many facets are intricate compositions, and humor. We combine a lofty and ambitious approach to songwriting with effortless wit and personality to come up with tunes that are equal parts catchy and challenging. Chompers has a little of everything, a lot of some great things, and none of the filler. They are a throwback to sounds that don’t exist yet; An enigma to classify, and a blast to watch.</p>

        <h1>Jeremy</h1>
        <p>The man without a plan. I learned to play drums from watching the movie Step-brothers on repeat for a whole summer. I enjoy a good free craft beer, did I mention that I enjoy free beer? As a true New Yorker, I enjoy all types of Italian foods and I was the brains behind month long spaghetti nights. I enjoy spending my free time as an instructor as the School of Rock in Boulder.</p>
